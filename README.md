This project was done using Flask and SQL Server. The database is connected with the help of the pyodbc package. 

BootStrap is a CSS framework for quickly styling your website. So we will be taking the CSS link and paste it inside the head tags of our website.

After that we go to the JS and copy all the scripts and paste that into the end of the body tags. This allows us to use a  library of different classes or different styling things to make our website look nicer. 
This is on a CDN which means we dont have to download any files as it automatically grabs the CSS and JS code from the net. We now try to create a Navigation bar. This is also available in BootStrap.

Nav Bar : https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/


We will now choose the nav bar code that we like and copy and place it on the top part of the body tag. We added this to our base template which means that any child template will have the nav bar at the top of it.
